Algorithm, it is designed to yield results for any valid input according to precisely defined instructions.
Input -> Computing Device(Algorithm) -> Output
So, what should we do first?
We need to understand the requirements, or we can say we need to understand the demand.
Why do we need the Algorithm, the reason is we need to solve some problem, why should we solve this problem, because we have demand.
Once the problem is clearly stated, we can start to develop.

The development phase consists of two phases:
    1. The design phase: You need to choose the fit algorithm. So, you should study, because you can compare the pros and cons of different algorithm, if you know more algorithm.
    2. The coding phase: Speech is cheap, show me your code.
